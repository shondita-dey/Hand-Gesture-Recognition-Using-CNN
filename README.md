- Organized gesture datasets into structured formats for training and testing

- Each gesture, like "thumbs up" or "three", was labelled with precision
  
- Standardized image dimensions using OpenCV for consistency

- Converted visual data into machine-readable formats, ensuring optimal model input

- Designed a neural network using TensorFlow to learn and recognize gestures accurately

- Assessed performance through confusion matrices and classification reports
